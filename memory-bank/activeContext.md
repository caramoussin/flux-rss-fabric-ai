# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Effect-based architecture implementation
- Core service layer refactoring
- Store layer with caching implementation
- Error handling system development
- Effect runtime configuration

## Recent Changes
- Created Effect-based error handling system
- Implemented Effect runtime configuration
