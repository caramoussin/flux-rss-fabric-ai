# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Testing Effect-based services (MCPClient, Crawl4AIClient)
- Testing Python microservices (Crawl4AI service)
- Refining Effect-based testing patterns
- Validating client-microservice interactions
- Ensuring test environment setup (TS and Python venv)

## Recent Changes
- Created Effect-based error handling system
- Implemented Effect runtime configuration
- Established service layer patterns
- Set up store layer with caching
- Created Vitest setup for Effect
- Implemented MCPClient tests
- Implemented WebScrapingService tests
- Implemented Crawl4AIClient tests (TypeScript)
- Setup Python testing environment (venv, dependencies) for Crawl4AI service
- Implemented and ran unit tests for Crawl4AI service (Python)
- Created global test setup `src/tests/setup.ts` with `Effect.resetRuntime()`
- Evaluated relevance and reliability of Crawl4AI tests

## Active Decisions
- Using Effect for functional programming
- Implementing dependency injection via Effect
- Adopting Effect-based error handling
- Using Effect for state management
- Implementing Effect-based caching
- Organizing services with Effect layers
- Testing with @effect/vitest
- Mocking external dependencies for tests (TS & Python)
- Using Pytest for Python service testing
- Using FastAPI's TestClient for Python API testing

## Current Considerations
- Effect composition patterns
- Service layer dependency management
- Store caching strategies
- Error handling granularity
- Effect runtime optimization
- Testing Effect-based code
- Mock implementation patterns
- Test coverage strategies
- Integration testing strategies for microservices
- Keeping mocks accurate for both TS and Python tests

## Next Steps
1. Implement FabricAIScrapingService tests
2. Complete service layer testing
3. Create test utilities for common testing operations
4. Address warnings in Python test output (Pydantic, deprecations)
5. Define integration testing approach for Crawl4AI service
6. Continue refactoring services to use Effect

## Open Questions
- Effect error handling best practices
- Store caching optimization strategies
- Effect composition patterns
- Service layer dependency management
- Testing Effect-based code
- Performance implications
- Mock implementation strategies (TS vs Python)
- Integration testing approaches for microservices

## Current Challenges
- Effect type system complexity
- Dependency injection setup
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Error handling patterns
- Testing Effect-based code
- Mocking external dependencies
- Testing services with complex dependencies
- Maintaining consistency between client mocks and actual service behavior
- Potential flakiness in integration tests
