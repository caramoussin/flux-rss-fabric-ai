# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Testing Effect-based services
- Implementing unit tests for core services
- Effect-based testing patterns
- Service layer validation
- Error handling validation
- WebScrapingService test completion

## Recent Changes
- Created Effect-based error handling system
- Implemented Effect runtime configuration
- Established service layer patterns
- Set up store layer with caching
- Created Vitest setup for Effect
- Implemented MCPClient tests
- Implemented WebScrapingService tests

## Active Decisions
- Using Effect for functional programming
- Implementing dependency injection via Effect
- Adopting Effect-based error handling
- Using Effect for state management
- Implementing Effect-based caching
- Organizing services with Effect layers
- Testing with @effect/vitest
- Mocking external dependencies for tests

## Current Considerations
- Effect composition patterns
- Service layer dependency management
- Store caching strategies
- Error handling granularity
- Effect runtime optimization
- Testing Effect-based code
- Mock implementation patterns
- Test coverage strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement FabricAIScrapingService tests
2. Complete service layer testing
3. Create test utilities for common testing operations
4. Create additional Effect-based UI hooks
5. Continue refactoring services to use Effect
6. Expand Effect-based testing coverage

## Open Questions
- Effect error handling best practices
- Store caching optimization strategies
- Effect composition patterns
- Service layer dependency management
- Testing Effect-based code
- Performance implications
- Mock implementation strategies
- Integration testing approaches

## Current Challenges
- Effect type system complexity
- Dependency injection setup
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Error handling patterns
- Testing Effect-based code
- Mocking external dependencies
- Testing services with complex dependencies

## Immediate Tasks
- [x] Fix MCPClient test file to use proper Effect testing patterns
- [x] Create WebScrapingService test file
- [x] Implement WebScrapingService mocks
- [x] Test different scraping scenarios
- [x] Test error handling in scraping operations
- [x] Test robots.txt checking functionality
- [ ] Create test utilities for common testing operations
- [ ] Implement FabricAIScrapingService tests
