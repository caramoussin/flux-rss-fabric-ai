## In Progress
- 🔄 FabricAIScrapingService tests
- 🔄 Service layer testing
- 🔄 Effect-based testing utilities
- 🔄 Mock implementation patterns
- 🔄 Error handling validation

## Pending
- ⏳ Effect-based UI components
- ⏳ Effect-based feed service
- ⏳ Effect-based AI agents
- ⏳ Effect store implementation
- ⏳ Integration tests with Effect
- ⏳ Effect documentation

## Known Issues
1. Linter errors in core Effect files
2. Mocking external dependencies complexity
3. Effect-based testing patterns refinement needed
4. Cache invalidation strategy needed
5. Effect type system complexity
