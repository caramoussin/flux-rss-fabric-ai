# Smart RSS Aggregator App Specification

## Overview

The **Smart RSS Aggregator App** is a local-first application designed to enhance content consumption through intelligent RSS feed aggregation and AI-powered analysis. Built with **Bun** and **SvelteKit**, it operates via a unified local server, ensuring user privacy, data ownership, and full offline functionality. The app extends beyond traditional RSS aggregation by incorporating **web scraping and HTML/JSON parsing**, leveraging **Crawl4AI** for robust content extraction. Powered by **Fabric AI**, it features three specialized AI agents—**the Archivist**, **the Scribe**, and **the Librarian**—to collect, summarize, and organize content into a personalized knowledge hub.
